#The .extend() method  is used to add multiple elements from another sequence (list, tuple, etc.) to the end of the original list
#It modifies the original list by extending/iterating it with the elements from the provided sequence.
#The .append() method is used to add a single element to the end of the original list
#The provided element is added as a single item to the list
