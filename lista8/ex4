#Using the .join() method and .split() method on a file

file = open("ids.txt", "r")
ids = file.read()
print("".join(ids.split())) 
#the string will be splited into individuals words using the split() method
#the join() method merges the words back into a single string, removing the whitespace, used as paramater, resulting in a single string without spaces
